For all potential moves:
    Piece cost per side
    How many moves king has
    How many pieces pinned to smth more valuable 
    How many pieces protected ( How many hanging)
    How many pieces attacking (Multiplying for lower -> higher cost piece, and more pieces on same target)
    Can you put king in check?

    Consider your eval, and enemy eval. (3 depth? 2 moves us, one move enemy, presuming enemy makes best move?)


Main game:
    Doing all the cheks was no unessecarily complicated,
    gone with just checking all possible moves each time. Shouldn't really be that bad.
    In the worst case (out of bounds of reality), around 700 checks. Will ALWAYS be lower
